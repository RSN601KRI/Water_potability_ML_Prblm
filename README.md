# Water Potability Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the potability of water based on various water quality parameters using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify water samples as either potable (safe to drink) or non-potable (unsafe to drink). The model uses features such as pH, hardness, conductivity, and other chemical properties of the water to make the prediction.

### Dataset
The dataset contains multiple water quality features and the target variable `Potability` that indicates whether the water is potable (`1`) or non-potable (`0`). The dataset consists of:
- **Features (X):** Water quality parameters like `ph`, `hardness`, `solids`, `chloramines`, `sulfate`, `conductivity`, `organic_carbon`, `density`, etc.
- **Target (y):** `Potability` (binary classification target indicating potable or non-potable water).

---

## Problem Definition
- **Objective:** Predict whether a water sample is potable or non-potable based on various quality parameters.
- **Input:** Multiple numeric features representing water quality metrics.
- **Output:** A binary classification (`1` for potable, `0` for non-potable).

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone this repository to your local machine to get started with the project.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-potability-prediction.git
   cd water-potability-prediction
   ```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
   The project requires several Python libraries. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **requirements.txt** should contain the following libraries:
   ```txt
   pandas
   numpy
   scikit-learn
   matplotlib
   seaborn
   ```

### 3. **Data Preparation**
   - The dataset is expected in two CSV files: `train.csv` (for training) and `test.csv` (for testing).
   - Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing such as:
     - Handling missing values
     - Feature extraction and conversion
     - Encoding the target variable

### 4. **Training the Model**
   We use **Random Forest Classifier** to build the model. The model is trained using the training dataset and validated using a hold-out validation set.

   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
   After training the model, evaluate its performance using accuracy or other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score on the validation set.

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
   y_val_pred = model.predict(X_val)
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, y_val_pred)
   print(f"Validation Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
   ```

### 6. **Making Predictions**
   After model evaluation, generate predictions on the test dataset and save them for submission.

   ```python
   test_predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   submission = pd.DataFrame({
       "Index": test_df["Index"],
       "Potability": test_predictions
   })
   submission.to_csv("submission.csv", index=False)
   ```

## Key Points
- **Data Preprocessing:** Ensure proper handling of missing values and conversion of non-numeric text features to numeric values.
- **Model Choice:** Random Forest is used for this classification task due to its ability to handle large datasets and its robustness against overfitting.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.
- **Submission File:** After generating predictions on the test set, the results are saved in a `submission.csv` file, which can be used for evaluation.

---

## Results
After training and evaluating the model, the final accuracy or performance metrics should indicate how well the model is able to classify water as potable or non-potable.

---

## Conclusion
This project provides a machine learning-based solution to predict the potability of water based on its chemical parameters. By using a Random Forest Classifier, we can classify water samples as either safe to drink or unsafe. Data preprocessing and proper model evaluation are key to building an accurate and robust solution for this classification problem.

## Future Work
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Further improve model performance by tuning the Random Forest model's hyperparameters.
- **Additional Features:** Incorporate additional water quality metrics or external data sources for improved predictions.
- **Model Comparison:** Experiment with other classification algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, SVM) to compare their performance.
